Churn Analysis Project Summary
This project utilizes SQL Server, Power BI, and Python to analyze customer churn, identify key drivers, and predict future churn. 

Key insights include:
Overall Churn Rate: 27.0% (1,732 out of 6,418 customers).
Age Factor: Higher churn in younger customers (20-35 age group).
Contract Duration: Shorter contracts (Month-to-Month, One Year) show higher churn rates.
Payment Methods: Mailed check payments correlate with higher churn, while bank withdrawals and credit cards have lower churn rates.
Geographical Variations: States like Jammu, Assam, and Jharkhand exhibit higher churn rates.

Key Influencing Factors:
Competitive Pressure: Competitors offering better devices, deals, and speeds.
Customer Service: Performance and attitude of service personnel.
Value Perception: Customers' views on pricing, data allowances, and service quality.

Notable Statistics:
Total customers: 6,418
Total churn: 1,732
New joiners: 411

Targeted Retention Strategies:
Focus on younger customers with tailored retention campaigns.
Implement targeted marketing in high-churn states.
Offer incentives for longer contracts and introduce flexible contract options.
Enhance customer service through training and feedback mechanisms.
